## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Payment probability calculation: <100ms
- Support 100+ concurrent payments per merchant
- Game state sync: 1-second latency
- IoT data anchoring: 1-second intervals

### Adoption
- 10+ developers using SDK
- 3+ production applications
- 1000+ transactions processed
- Community contributions

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Kaspa Network Changes**: Monitor Kaspa development, maintain compatibility
2. **Performance Issues**: Early benchmarking, optimization sprints
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Regular audits, bug bounty program
4. **Adoption Challenges**: Strong documentation, example apps, developer support
